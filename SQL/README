This folder provides PostgreSQL statements, queries and functions to

- set up the data model required for OBIA4RTM (see ./Tables)

- set up functions for the parameter retrieval and queries to obtain results from the database (./Queries_Functions)

By default, the public-Schema will be used. In case OBIA4RTM shall be used for various regions independendly, it is suggested
to use an additional schema for each additional setting.
